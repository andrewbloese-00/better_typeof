# Better typeof
I was tired of how limited the default typeof operator was in javascript, so I build one that can correctly distinguish between arrays, null, objects, and custom classes! Also an option to use "better numbers" to distinguish between float and int when type checking. 

I know, just use TypeScript, but then I wouldn't be reinventing any wheels...
